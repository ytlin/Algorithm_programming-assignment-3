Repo for assignment 3 announcement and discussion.

## Filename format
As we have only one program in this assignment, please name you file as:
- `Prog.c` (for using C)
- `Prog.cpp` (for using C++)

## Commit requirement
Please **at least** commit each program for **two** commits, don't do them all in a single commit.

## Input / Output

We use standart input(stdin) and standard output(stdout) as the input and output of the programs, not files.

The inputs will be multiple numbers that be seperated by space, tab or newline character, and end  with a `x` alphabet, there will be at most 10000 inputs.

Here is an example of the input:
`-2  1  -3  4 -1  2  1  -5  4  x`

The corresponding output should be:
`6`
